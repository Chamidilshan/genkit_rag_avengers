[210]\\n A Black Ops team called the Avengers debuted sometime after the Ultimatum storyline. This version was\\n a project headed up by Nick Fury and Tony Stark's brother Gregory Stark to bring Captain America back. Its known members consisted of War Machine, Hawkeye, Black Widow II, Spider (an Asian in an orange\\n and purple Spider-Man outfit who once claimed to be a spliced clone of Spider-Man and Professor X\\n from the future), Tyrone Cash (who was the original Hulk before Bruce Banner), Red Wasp (a former\\n Liberators member), and \\n Nerd Hulk\\n (an intelligent clone of Hulk who lacks Hulk's rage). [211]\\n Additional\\n members included \\n Punisher\\n (who joined the Avengers against a \\n Ghost Rider\\n manhunt)\\n [212]\\n and the half\\n vampire \\n Blade\\n (who joined the group to help against a \\n vampire\\n invasion). [213]\\n Three animated series have been based on the team. The Avengers: United They Stand was mainly based on the Roy Thomas era of the group,\\n and ran from 1999 to 2000.

the acquisition by Disney in 2009, Marvel films began to be marketed at the Innoventions attraction\\n in Tomorrowland at Disneyland.
